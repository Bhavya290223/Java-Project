With its *smart and intelligent algorithm*, you can find the best show in just a few clicks and recommend to our whole audience. From latest to old, from spine-tingling to rib-tickling,

With its **simple interface**, movie-lovers and serial watchers can save some time searching for a great watch in the internet.

This project interests me because with the onset of new generation and technologies, entertainment content has diversified and countless
things to watch has emerged. Many people including me often faces a dilemma to find the best watch
